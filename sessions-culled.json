He then shows how this framework and these models can be used to understand, plan and manage a variety of landuse/management projects. He presents nine different strategies for proposing change and shows how they can be applied to different problem types at different scales, discussing the pros and cons of each in different situations.

The maps in these collections could prove invaluable in providing views into the past, and these situations run counter to the common expectation that everything of value, or required for reference and research, best serves the needs of the mapping community by being available through the Internet. The web offers the best opportunity for archiving and sharing these collections with wider audiences. A good example is the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Historical Topographic Map Explorer—a web application (app) that provides users access to almost 180,000 scanned maps through an interface that provides easy exploration, visual comparison, and speedy download of maps in the collection. Using this web app as an example, the workshop takes you step-by-step through a solution for converting map collections to a format that can be shared online. You’ll start with scanning, georeferencing, and building metadata for the maps. You’ll learn how the map images are converted from raster data to image services that can be viewed on the web.

Geospatial analysis is a powerful tool in planning emergency responses and recovery efforts, and delivers highly useful products for decision makers. However this is often done by GIS analysts at arms-length using specialized systems, and so GIS is seen as a separate practice rather than part of the core process. Given the importance of spatial analysis, the challenge is to make this a core capability easily accessed by users with little training or knowledge, without losing or ‘dumbing down’ the power and value that GIS offers Response and recovery procedures and planning can be visualized within an information system to provide simple, ‘checklist’-style views and a bouncing ball that any user can follow. They can also be automated while still bringing in human judgment where required, but letting systems take care as much as possible of the analysis, tasking and communicating decisions and outcomes. This ensures key processes are followed, relieves the cognitive load on responders at times of stress and high tempo, saves wasted time looking manuals and plans, and so freeing them to focus on key decisions and the actual response. GIS enabled analysis can be fully automated as steps within an overall workflow, bringing GIS and the role of spatial analysis into the mainstream.","contacts":" Owen Prime - Noggin IT","room":"Demo Theater 3 - Public Safety","sessionID":"9393","offeringID":"21218"},{"startDay":"21","startDate":"7/21/2015 11:30:00 AM","endDate":"7/21/2015 12:15:00 PM","sessionTitle":"Integrating History and Ecology with Wormsloe App","eventTypeID":"27","sessionDescription":"The multidisciplinary aspects of the Wormsloe Historic Site are integrated into a robust visitor experience as physical features of the site are integrated into a seamless interpretation through time and space. ","contacts":" Sarah Ross - The University of Georgia-Center for Research + Ed","room":"Demo Theater 1 - Non-Profit","sessionID":"9427","offeringID":"21254"},{"startDay":"21","startDate":"7/21/2015 11:30:00 AM","endDate":"7/21/2015 12:15:00 PM","sessionTitle":"Smart Elections","eventTypeID":"27","sessionDescription":"","contacts":" Rich Leadbeater - Esri","room":"Demo Theater 2 - State and Local Government","sessionID":"9383","offeringID":"21200"},{"startDay":"21","startDate":"7/21/2015 11:30:00 AM","endDate":"7/21/2015 11:45:00 AM","sessionTitle":"Story Maps - Simple Yet Compelling","eventTypeID":"29","sessionDescription":"","contacts":" Jon Bowen - Esri","room":"Showcase - UX/UI","sessionID":"9332","offeringID":"21139"},{"startDay":"21","startDate":"7/21/2015 11:45:00 AM","endDate":"7/21/2015 12:00:00 PM","sessionTitle":"Brainstorming in an Agile World","eventTypeID":"29","sessionDescription":"","contacts":" Frank Garofalo - Esri","room":"Showcase - UX/UI","sessionID":"9323","offeringID":"21130"},{"startDay":"21","startDate":"7/21/2015 12:00:00 PM","endDate":"7/21/2015 12:15:00 PM","sessionTitle":"The Default Effect: Finding the Balance between Guided and Flexible","eventTypeID":"29","sessionDescription":"","contacts":" Flora Vale - Esri","room":"Showcase - UX/UI","sessionID":"9324","offeringID":"21131"},{"startDay":"21","startDate":"7/21/2015 12:00:00 PM","endDate":"7/21/2015 1:00:00 PM","sessionTitle":"Agriculture SIG","eventTypeID":"5","sessionDescription":"Come network with users and industry experts while learning of the latest ArcGIS offerings for Agriculture.","contacts":"","room":"Room 32 A","sessionID":"9373","offeringID":"21187"},{"startDay":"21","startDate":"7/21/2015 12:00:00 PM","endDate":"7/21/2015 1:00:00 PM","sessionTitle":"FWS GIS Users Group","eventTypeID":"5","sessionDescription":"Presentation on US Fish and Wildlife Service Geospatial Services 2015 Strategy, Use of ArcGIS Online for FWS, Use of ArcGIS Portal for FWS - mainly a discussion for US FWS GIS users","contacts":"","room":"Room 28 B","sessionID":"9335","offeringID":"21142"},{"startDay":"21","startDate":"7/21/2015 12:00:00 PM","endDate":"7/21/2015 1:00:00 PM","sessionTitle":"Petroleum SIG","eventTypeID":"5","sessionDescription":"Please join us at the Petroleum Special Interest Group to get updates and information from our industry experts.","contacts":"","room":"Room 28 E","sessionID":"9337","offeringID":"21231"},{"startDay":"21","startDate":"7/21/2015 12:00:00 PM","endDate":"7/21/2015 1:00:00 PM","sessionTitle":"Analyzing geospatial data with IBM Cloud Data Services & Esri ArcGIS","eventTypeID":"7","sessionDescription":"This session introduces you to the geospatial analytics in dashDB, IBM's cloud data warehouse service.

Simple procedures include extruding building footprints by a height attribute, rotating a park bench by a rotation attribute, and resizing a threat-dome sphere by a distance attribute. Complex procedures are available through CityEngine, where you can write a procedural rule that can, for example, convert a building footprint into a seventeenth-century Parisian building, or convert a land-use polygon into the maximum structure that would still conform to the city's zoning laws. Procedural content is especially effective for iterative design-and-analyze geodesign workflows, where you can simply change a few feature attributes and quickly regenerate an updated design. CityEngine capabilities can also be accessed directly from ArcGIS for Desktop – both through a geoprocessing tool and as ‘procedural symbol’ in ArcGIS Pro – making procedurally generated 3D content readily available for all ArcGIS 3D Analyst users.","contacts":" Nathan Shephard - Esri, Eric Wittner - Esri","room":"Room 14 A","sessionID":"8606","offeringID":"20201"},{"startDay":"22","startDate":"7/22/2015 8:30:00 AM","endDate":"7/22/2015 9:45:00 AM","sessionTitle":"Mobile GIS and Inspections","eventTypeID":"1","sessionDescription":"Mobile GIS is giving utilities new ways of communicating with employees, streamlining workforce management, and ensuring compliance with regulations.

Geospatial analysis is a powerful tool in planning emergency responses and recovery efforts, and delivers highly useful products for decision makers. However this is often done by GIS analysts at arms-length using specialized systems, and so GIS is seen as a separate practice rather than part of the core process. Given the importance of spatial analysis, the challenge is to make this a core capability easily accessed by users with little training or knowledge, without losing or ‘dumbing down’ the power and value that GIS offers Response and recovery procedures and planning can be visualized within an information system to provide simple, ‘checklist’-style views and a bouncing ball that any user can follow. They can also be automated while still bringing in human judgment where required, but letting systems take care as much as possible of the analysis, tasking and communicating decisions and outcomes. This ensures key processes are followed, relieves the cognitive load on responders at times of stress and high tempo, saves wasted time looking manuals and plans, and so freeing them to focus on key decisions and the actual response. GIS enabled analysis can be fully automated as steps within an overall workflow, bringing GIS and the role of spatial analysis into the mainstream.","contacts":" Owen Prime - Noggin IT","room":"Demo Theater 3 - Public Safety","sessionID":"9393","offeringID":"21219"},{"startDay":"22","startDate":"7/22/2015 11:30:00 AM","endDate":"7/22/2015 12:15:00 PM","sessionTitle":"Modern Approach to Land Records","eventTypeID":"27","sessionDescription":"ArcGIS for Land Records is a complete geospatial platform for land records management.
