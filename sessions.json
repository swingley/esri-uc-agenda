A good example is the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Historical Topographic Map Explorer—a web application (app) that provides users access to almost 180,000 scanned maps through an interface that provides easy exploration, visual comparison, and speedy download of maps in the collection. Using this web app as an example, the workshop takes you step-by-step through a solution for converting map collections to a format that can be shared online. You’ll start with scanning, georeferencing, and building metadata for the maps. You’ll learn how the map images are converted from raster data to image services that can be viewed on the web. Finally, you’ll learn how to create web maps and use them in the web app that provides the user interface and functionality for useful and engaging online map exploration.","conferenceID":"93","RowIdentity":"435"},{"offeringID":"21243","sessionID":"9416","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"4","startDate":"7/19/2015 2:00:00 PM","endDate":"7/19/2015 5:00:00 PM","duration":"3.00","startDay":"19","startHour":"14","startMinute":"0","startMonth":"7","startYear":"2015","dateID":"20150719","endDay":"19","endHour":"17","endMinute":"0","endMonth":"7","endYear":"2015","istSessionID":"1701","istScheduleID":"3109","accesscode":"4810","sessionTitle":"Esri Agriculture Forum","eventTypeDescription":"Special Interest Group Meeting","eventTypeID":"5","room":"Room 30 C","floor":"","xPoint":"","yPoint":"","contacts":"","presenters":"","paperTitle":"","parentsupertracks":"4","tracks":"5","supertracks":"15","sessionDescription":"The Esri Agriculture Forum is a place for the GIS Community to come, share and learn about the latest innovations in the ArcGIS platform for Agriculture.

The stories they tell are told with an objective, goal, or desired outcome in mind, to communicate more and inspire us to achieve goals that we didn't think were possible.","conferenceID":"93","RowIdentity":"327"},{"offeringID":"19993","sessionID":"8687","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"2","startDate":"7/21/2015 8:30:00 AM","endDate":"7/21/2015 9:45:00 AM","duration":"1.25","startDay":"21","startHour":"8","startMinute":"30","startMonth":"7","startYear":"2015","dateID":"20150721","endDay":"21","endHour":"9","endMinute":"45","endMonth":"7","endYear":"2015","istSessionID":"1074","istScheduleID":"1412","accesscode":"2486","sessionTitle":"Telecom: Enterprise Integration","eventTypeDescription":"Moderated Paper Session","eventTypeID":"1","room":"Marina - Salon E","floor":"","xPoint":"","yPoint":"","contacts":"","presenters":"Edward Gause|J Dowling|Paulo Simão","paperTitle":"Mapping Evolution: Going from the Flintstones to the Jetsons|Sharing Telecommunication Maps throughout the Company with ESRI Portal|OI Telecom - Location Analytics spread throughout the organization","parentsupertracks":"4","tracks":"573","supertracks":"21","sessionDescription":"The papers in this session will demonstrate how companies can access and share data through a single GIS platform enabling anyone to easily visualize and share data.","conferenceID":"93","RowIdentity":"478"},{"offeringID":"20265","sessionID":"8519","offeringCount":"2","levelID":"2","startDate":"7/21/2015 8:30:00 AM","endDate":"7/21/2015 9:45:00 AM","duration":"1.25","startDay":"21","startHour":"8","startMinute":"30","startMonth":"7","startYear":"2015","dateID":"20150721","endDay":"21","endHour":"9","endMinute":"45","endMonth":"7","endYear":"2015","istSessionID":"739","istScheduleID":"1714","accesscode":"2453","sessionTitle":"Editing Multiuser Geodatabases: An Introduction","eventTypeDescription":"Technical Workshop","eventTypeID":"4","room":"Room 32 B","floor":"","xPoint":"","yPoint":"","contacts":" Shawn Thorne - Esri, Cheryl Cleghorn - Esri","presenters":"","paperTitle":"","parentsupertracks":"5","tracks":"290","supertracks":"25","sessionDescription":"Building on the key elements of the geodatabase discussed in the ‘Geodatabase: An Introduction session’, this session will provide an introduction to the functionality in ArcMap specific to enterprise geodatabases.

Geospatial analysis is a powerful tool in planning emergency responses and recovery efforts, and delivers highly useful products for decision makers. However this is often done by GIS analysts at arms-length using specialized systems, and so GIS is seen as a separate practice rather than part of the core process. Given the importance of spatial analysis, the challenge is to make this a core capability easily accessed by users with little training or knowledge, without losing or ‘dumbing down’ the power and value that GIS offers Response and recovery procedures and planning can be visualized within an information system to provide simple, ‘checklist’-style views and a bouncing ball that any user can follow. They can also be automated while still bringing in human judgment where required, but letting systems take care as much as possible of the analysis, tasking and communicating decisions and outcomes. This ensures key processes are followed, relieves the cognitive load on responders at times of stress and high tempo, saves wasted time looking manuals and plans, and so freeing them to focus on key decisions and the actual response. GIS enabled analysis can be fully automated as steps within an overall workflow, bringing GIS and the role of spatial analysis into the mainstream.","conferenceID":"93","RowIdentity":"1457"},{"offeringID":"21254","sessionID":"9427","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"4","startDate":"7/21/2015 11:30:00 AM","endDate":"7/21/2015 12:15:00 PM","duration":"0.75","startDay":"21","startHour":"11","startMinute":"30","startMonth":"7","startYear":"2015","dateID":"20150721","endDay":"21","endHour":"12","endMinute":"15","endMonth":"7","endYear":"2015","istSessionID":"1729","istScheduleID":"3129","accesscode":"4858","sessionTitle":"Integrating History and Ecology with Wormsloe App","eventTypeDescription":"Demo Theater Presentation","eventTypeID":"27","room":"Demo Theater 1 -

Native apps can also run beautifully even while disconnected from the network, and that is important when you are on the run. Finally, native apps can be published into the Google Play and Apple app stores and that is not only cool but actually a big deal if you want reach out to the general public. Can you imagine your own branded mapping app in the app stores?In this session we will introduce to you AppStudio for ArcGIS. You will be amazed how easily, and quickly, you can assemble fully functional mapping apps and run them pretty much anywhere... in a smartphone, in a tablet and even on your own Windows or Mac.

Regression analysis also allows you to predict spatial outcomes for other places or time periods. Application and use of Ordinary least squares regression (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) will be demonstrated.  You will learn how to build a properly specified OLS model and interpret the results and diagnostics. As part of developing a well specified model we will use Exploratory Regression to more efficiently identify relationships within data.

This presentations takes the audience on a ride thru the world of OGC and ISO standards that have critical bearing on an Organization’s interoperability requirements. Organizations choose to adopt standards-compliant architectures to assure themselves that their ultimate implementation will be interoperable. Large organization that are data providers need to be cognizant of the fact that their customers and end-users require that the data be easily discoverable and readily consumable. This requires a workflow that will inherently require navigating thru data, metadata and service protocols. This presentation will review many of the popular standards based formats and protocols and their support within the ArcGIS platform. A good understanding of the “standards” space and the available solutions will help organizations better articulate their requirements for pragmatic interoperability.","conferenceID":"93","RowIdentity":"745"},{"offeringID":"19836","sessionID":"8435","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"1","startDate":"7/21/2015 3:15:00 PM","endDate":"7/21/2015 4:30:00 PM","duration":"1.25","startDay":"21","startHour":"15","startMinute":"15","startMonth":"7","startYear":"2015","dateID":"20150721","endDay":"21","endHour":"16","endMinute":"30","endMonth":"7","endYear":"2015","istSessionID":"558","istScheduleID":"1225","accesscode":"1783","sessionTitle":"Environmental Health Concerns","eventTypeDescription":"Moderated Paper Session","eventTypeID":"1","room":"Room 28 C","floor":"","xPoint":"","yPoint":"","contacts":"","presenters":"Jeff Blossom|Sandra Gaskell|Walker Wieland","paperTitle":"CalEnviroScreen|Mapping Asthma Stressors: An All-Encompassing Inventory","parentsupertracks":"4","tracks":"595","supertracks":"13","sessionDescription":"","conferenceID":"93","RowIdentity":"330"},{"offeringID":"19789","sessionID":"8397","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"1","startDate":"7/21/2015 3:15:00 PM","endDate":"7/21/2015 4:30:00 PM","duration":"1.25","startDay":"21","startHour":"15","startMinute":"15","startMonth":"7","startYear":"2015","dateID":"20150721","endDay":"21","endHour":"16","endMinute":"30","endMonth":"7","endYear":"2015","istSessionID":"512","istScheduleID":"1177","accesscode":"1689","sessionTitle":"Forestry: Inventories & Planning","eventTypeDescription":"Moderated Paper Session","eventTypeID":"1","room":"Room 27 B","floor":"","xPoint":"","yPoint":"","contacts":"","presenters":"Brad Weigle|Brian Maki|Jason Stephens|Tracey Frescino","paperTitle":"Michigan’s Department of Natural Resources Inventory Data Migration|Integrating R in a GIS environment for National Forest planning|Automated Feature Extraction from Aerial Imagery for Forestry Projects","parentsupertracks":"4","tracks":"30","supertracks":"15","sessionDescription":"This session will explore diverse applications of GIS in conducting forest inventories and planning.","conferenceID":"93","RowIdentity":"286"},{"offeringID":"19715","sessionID":"8415","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"1","startDate":"7/21/2015 3:15:00 PM","endDate":"7/21/2015 4:30:00 PM","duration":"1.25","startDay":"21","startHour":"15","startMinute":"15","startMonth":"7","startYear":"2015","dateID":"20150721","endDay":"21","endHour":"16","endMinute":"30","endMonth":"7","endYear":"2015","istSessionID":"537","istScheduleID":"1103","accesscode":"1640","sessionTitle":"Infrastructure/Siting","eventTypeDescription":"Moderated Paper Session","eventTypeID":"1","room":"Room 23 C","floor":"","xPoint":"","yPoint":"","contacts":"","presenters":"Byron Woertz|Constantine Tonias|Daniel Moreno|Steve Rhyne|Ted Harrington","paperTitle":"Challenges for finding a bridge location|Well Pad Design and Heavy Truck Freight Transport|Modeling Environmental Risk for Electricity Transmission Planning","parentsupertracks":"4","tracks":"4","supertracks":"11","sessionDescription":"GIS plays a critical role in site optimization.

Finally, we will share best practices for documenting, describing, and making your content easily discoverable to members of your organization.","conferenceID":"93","RowIdentity":"1207"},{"offeringID":"21066","sessionID":"9264","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"4","startDate":"7/21/2015 5:30:00 PM","endDate":"7/21/2015 7:00:00 PM","duration":"1.50","startDay":"21","startHour":"17","startMinute":"30","startMonth":"7","startYear":"2015","dateID":"20150721","endDay":"21","endHour":"19","endMinute":"0","endMonth":"7","endYear":"2015","istSessionID":"1492","istScheduleID":"2877","accesscode":"4369","sessionTitle":"Northeast Arc Users Group","eventTypeDescription":"Regional User Group Meeting","eventTypeID":"6","room":"Room 24 A","floor":"","xPoint":"","yPoint":"","contacts":"","presenters":"","paperTitle":"","parentsupertracks":"","tracks":"","supertracks":"","sessionDescription":"Meeting for NEARC members attending User Conference","conferenceID":"93","RowIdentity":"1352"},{"offeringID":"20424","sessionID":"8781","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"4","startDate":"7/21/2015 5:30:00 PM","endDate":"7/21/2015 7:00:00 PM","duration":"1.50","startDay":"21","startHour":"17","startMinute":"30","startMonth":"7","startYear":"2015","dateID":"20150721","endDay":"21","endHour":"19","endMinute":"0","endMonth":"7","endYear":"2015","istSessionID":"1270","istScheduleID":"1999","accesscode":"3269","sessionTitle":"Southeast Regional User Reception","eventTypeDescription":"Regional User Group Meeting","eventTypeID":"6","room":"West Terrace (Upper Level)","floor":"","xPoint":"","yPoint":"","contacts":"","presenters":"","paperTitle":"","parentsupertracks":"","tracks":"","supertracks":"","sessionDescription":"Reception for GIS professionals from the Southeast.","conferenceID":"93","RowIdentity":"894"},{"offeringID":"20415","sessionID":"8765","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"4","startDate":"7/21/2015 5:30:00 PM","endDate":"7/21/2015 7:00:00 PM","duration":"1.50","startDay":"21","startHour":"17","startMinute":"30","startMonth":"7","startYear":"2015","dateID":"20150721","endDay":"21","endHour":"19","endMinute":"0","endMonth":"7","endYear":"2015","istSessionID":"1238","istScheduleID":"1906","accesscode":"3144","sessionTitle":"Dakotas User Group","eventTypeDescription":"Regional User Group Meeting","eventTypeID":"6","room":"Room 23 B","floor":"","xPoint":"","yPoint":"","contacts":"","presenters":"","paperTitle":"","parentsupertracks":"","tracks":"","supertracks":"","sessionDescription":"","conferenceID":"93","RowIdentity":"886"},{"offeringID":"20343","sessionID":"8766","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"4","startDate":"7/21/2015 5:30:00 PM","endDate":"7/21/2015 7:00:00 PM","duration":"1.50","startDay":"21","startHour":"17","startMinute":"30","startMonth":"7","startYear":"2015","dateID":"20150721","endDay":"21","endHour":"19","endMinute":"0","endMonth":"7","endYear":"2015","istSessionID":"1239","istScheduleID":"1798","accesscode":"3037","sessionTitle":"Middle East, North Africa and West Asia Regional User Group Meeting","eventTypeDescription":"Regional User Group Meeting","eventTypeID":"6","room":"Room 14 B","floor":"","xPoint":"","yPoint":"","contacts":"","presenters":"","paperTitle":"","parentsupertracks":"","tracks":"","supertracks":"","sessionDescription":"Regional User Group Meeting for UC attendees from the Middle East, North Africa and West Asia.

Simple procedures include extruding building footprints by a height attribute, rotating a park bench by a rotation attribute, and resizing a threat-dome sphere by a distance attribute. Complex procedures are available through CityEngine, where you can write a procedural rule that can, for example, convert a building footprint into a seventeenth-century Parisian building, or convert a land-use polygon into the maximum structure that would still conform to the city's zoning laws. Procedural content is especially effective for iterative design-and-analyze geodesign workflows, where you can simply change a few feature attributes and quickly regenerate an updated design. CityEngine capabilities can also be accessed directly from ArcGIS for Desktop – both through a geoprocessing tool and as ‘procedural symbol’ in ArcGIS Pro – making procedurally generated 3D content readily available for all ArcGIS 3D Analyst users.","conferenceID":"93","RowIdentity":"679"},{"offeringID":"19900","sessionID":"8622","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"1","startDate":"7/22/2015 8:30:00 AM","endDate":"7/22/2015 9:45:00 AM","duration":"1.25","startDay":"22","startHour":"8","startMinute":"30","startMonth":"7","startYear":"2015","dateID":"20150722","endDay":"22","endHour":"9","endMinute":"45","endMonth":"7","endYear":"2015","istSessionID":"937","istScheduleID":"1291","accesscode":"2228","sessionTitle":"Mobile GIS and Inspections","eventTypeDescription":"Moderated Paper Session","eventTypeID":"1","room":"Room 29 C","floor":"","xPoint":"","yPoint":"","contacts":"","presenters":"Joshua DeWees|Sharon Parker|Theron Roby","paperTitle":"Designing a Utility Vegetation Management GIS Application for Mobile","parentsupertracks":"4","tracks":"24","supertracks":"21","sessionDescription":"Mobile GIS is giving utilities new ways of communicating with employees, streamlining workforce management, and ensuring compliance with regulations.

Geospatial analysis is a powerful tool in planning emergency responses and recovery efforts, and delivers highly useful products for decision makers. However this is often done by GIS analysts at arms-length using specialized systems, and so GIS is seen as a separate practice rather than part of the core process. Given the importance of spatial analysis, the challenge is to make this a core capability easily accessed by users with little training or knowledge, without losing or ‘dumbing down’ the power and value that GIS offers Response and recovery procedures and planning can be visualized within an information system to provide simple, ‘checklist’-style views and a bouncing ball that any user can follow. They can also be automated while still bringing in human judgment where required, but letting systems take care as much as possible of the analysis, tasking and communicating decisions and outcomes. This ensures key processes are followed, relieves the cognitive load on responders at times of stress and high tempo, saves wasted time looking manuals and plans, and so freeing them to focus on key decisions and the actual response. GIS enabled analysis can be fully automated as steps within an overall workflow, bringing GIS and the role of spatial analysis into the mainstream.","conferenceID":"93","RowIdentity":"1458"},{"offeringID":"21208","sessionID":"9389","offeringCount":"2","levelID":"4","startDate":"7/22/2015 11:30:00 AM","endDate":"7/22/2015 12:15:00 PM","duration":"0.75","startDay":"22","startHour":"11","startMinute":"30","startMonth":"7","startYear":"2015","dateID":"20150722","endDay":"22","endHour":"12","endMinute":"15","endMonth":"7","endYear":"2015","istSessionID":"1679","istScheduleID":"3071","accesscode":"4750","sessionTitle":"Modern Approach to Land Records","eventTypeDescription":"Demo Theater Presentation","eventTypeID":"27","room":"Demo Theater 2 - State and Local Government","floor":"","xPoint":"","yPoint":"","contacts":" Brent Jones - Esri","presenters":"","paperTitle":"","parentsupertracks":"","tracks":"","supertracks":"","sessionDescription":"ArcGIS for Land Records is a complete geospatial platform for land records management.
